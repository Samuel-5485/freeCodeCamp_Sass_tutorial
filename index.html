<!--store data with Sass Variable-->
<!--One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables.
they are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.
in JavaScript, varables are defiined using the let and const keywords, in Sass
variables start with a $ folled bythe variable name.
                here are a couple examples:
                $main-fonts:Arial, sans-serif;
                $heading-color: green;
                & also to use the variables:
                h1{
                font-family:$main-fonts;
                color:$heading-color;
                }-->
<style type="text/scss">
    /* create reusable css with mixins*/
    /*in Sass a mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throught the
    style sheet. the defn start with the @mixin at rule, followed by a custom name, 
    you apply the mixin also using @include*/
    
    @mixin shape($w, $h, $bg-color){
  width:$w;
  height:$h;
  background-color:$bg-color;
}

#square{
@include shape(50px, 50px, red);
}
#rect-a {
  @include shape(100px, 50px, blue);
}

#rect-b {
  @include shape(50px, 100px,orange)
}
/*use @if and @else to add logic to your styles*/
/*the @if directive in Sass is useful to rest for a specific case it works just like the if keyword
in the JavaScript.*/
/*example; create a mixin called border-stroke that takes a paramerer $val. the mixin should check for the following
conditions using @if, @else if, & @else directives
        light - 1px solid black
        medium - 3px solid black
        heavy - 6px solid black*/
@mixin border-stroke($val){
    @if $val == light{
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
    @else if $val == medium{
        boder:3px solid black;
    }
    @else if $val == heavy{
        border:6px solid black;
    }
    else{
        border:none;
    }
}
/*use @for to create a Sass loop */
/*The @for directive adds styles in a loop, very similar to a for loop ini javascript.*/
/*@for is used in two ways: 'start through end' or 'start to end' */
@for $j from 1 through 5{
    .text-#{$j} {font-size:15px * $j;}
}
    </style>
